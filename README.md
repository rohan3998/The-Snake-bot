# The-Snake-bot

The snake bot is an autonomous bot which moves due to its body convolutions just like an original snake does. Though it does have wheels, they are not motorised and their only purpose is to ensure that the friction faced by the bot along its length is less than that perpendicular to it (again just like it is in an original snake).The snake contains 6 segments actuated by servo motors and joined with metal brackets. The servos are controlled by an Arduino Mega and powered by a power bank(10.5 V) and a 7.4 V Lithium ion battery.
